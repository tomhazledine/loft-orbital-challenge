# Work Summary

The steps taken to build this app, in order.

## 1. Setup dev environment

* Init my default "app scaffold" which I use to quickly bootstrap new projects; it's not comprehensive but I do know *exactly* what's in it so it's good env for fast experimentation.
* Setup `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` to run the app in a container.
* Install Apollo Client and React Router to begin experimenting with the provided API.
* Setup basic routing and app behaviour with React.
* At this point I'm pretty sure the app will involve navigating to continents, so I add a placeholder `Continent` component and route, in addition to standard Home and Error pages.

Time: ~1 hour

## 2. Brainstorming

Gathering UI reference, genererically thinking about the app, and making notes. Brainstorming documented in [./research/notes.md](./research/notes.md).

Time: ~1 week ðŸ˜†
